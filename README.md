A program I wrote in sophomore year to assign me algebra and calculus
problems, as part of my struggle to meet the standards of my math
teacher. (I think. She didn't want me learning calculus, so I have no
clue why I put it in here.) It generates a LaTeX file with the problems
in it. I should combine it with `analysis.py` so that it could simplify
the expressions.  I remember this program taking less time to write than
my actual math homework.
